With the purpose of providing prospective web developers the opportunity to review their knowledge of the fundamentals, we decided to create a timed quiz app containing questions relating to the basic syntax and methods of the languages we have been learning in Bootcamo and the tools we have been employing. In addition, the creation of such an application from scratch allowed the author much needed practice in implementing user story requirements by employing notions like DOM traversal, the dynamic generation of content, event listeners, time intervals and basic client-side storage. The application was designed to be responsive enough so that it can be used without issues in screens of various sizes.
